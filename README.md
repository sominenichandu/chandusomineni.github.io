# Chandu's Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website created as part of the Web Development Final Project. The goal of this project was to design and build a professional-looking site that highlights my web development skills, showcases my previous work, and provides an easy way for others to contact me.

The website is structured with the following sections:

→ Home: Introduction with profile image and About Me toggle

→ Skills: Display of my technical skills (Frontend and Backend) in a responsive grid

→ Works/Projects: Showcasing selected projects with descriptions and GitHub links

→ Contact: Interactive Contact form with JavaScript validation and console logging, along with social links

The site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, following best practices for responsive web design. The project demonstrates the use of Bootstrap components, DOM manipulation with JavaScript, form validation, and clean, modern UI design. This portfolio will serve as a showcase of my work and skills as I continue to grow as a web developer and aspiring software engineer.
